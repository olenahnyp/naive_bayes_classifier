# Naive Bayes Classifier
The main idea of the classifier is to detect whether a message is spam or not spam.

Firstly, we created a file with some stop words. This words are meaningless and will be excluded from all the messages. Then, we trained our model on the most common words in spam messages and the most common words in ham messages. After that, we checked the classifier on some random messages and it was correct in 96% of the time.

The attached files contain the classier and, in addition, some visualization of the most common words and accuracy.
